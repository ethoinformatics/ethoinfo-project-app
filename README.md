Ethoinformatics Project PhoneGap Application
=================================

An research project-specific application in PhoneGap that is built upon the [Ethoinfo Framework](https://github.com/ethoinformatics/ethoinfo-framework). The project repo will contain the data structures needed for a particular project. 

In the current experimental phase, we are using data structures tailored to Tony DiFiore's Proyecto project.
